Documentation Archive
=====================

The FishDuino library for Arduino was based on the documentation in this directory.

I had to search long and far for this information, and a lot of links to other documentation were dead already. I stored these documents here in Github in the hope that this will be safe for many years to come, even if for some reason the original locations will cease to exist.

No copyright infringement or trademark infringement was intended, and some of the documents even encourage redistribution. Nevertheless, if you see your work here and would like it to be taken offline, I will be happy to remove it.

Many thanks to those who did the original research and reverse engineering! Without you, the Fishduino project would probably not exist.

Vielen Dank an alle fuer eure Beitraege! Ohne euch wuerde das Fishduino projekt nicht existieren!
